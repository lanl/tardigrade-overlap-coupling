A stub repository for C++ development projects in W-13.

This repository will contain the necessary setup files to integrate C++ doc
strings, `CMake`_, `Doxygen`_, `Sphinx`_, and `Breathe`_ for a complete build
system with integrated documentation. It will also include the necessary hooks
to commonly used C++ libraries for constitutive modeling. This stub repository
also includes template hooks for integrating C++ code as Abaqus subroutines.

.. note::

   You can use this repo as a stub for fortran projects as well! A
   step-by-step may never happen because c++ is the future of W-13 subroutines.
   For now, refer to the following references:

   * `CMake for Fortran example CMakeLists.txt`_
   * `CMake documentation starting point`_
   * `Stack Overflow thread`_
   * `Doxygen comments for Fortran`_
