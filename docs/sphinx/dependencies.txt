Dependencies
************

.. include:: md2rst.txt

Compilers
=========

* c++11 compiler (listed version number has been tested at some point)

  * g++ >= GNU 4.8.5

Executables
===========

* `CMake`_ >= 3.14
* `Doxygen`_ >= 1.8.5
* `LaTeX`_ >= 2017

Python Modules (for documentation)
==================================

For convenience, the minimal Python environment requirements for the
documentation build are included in ``configuration_files/environment.yaml``.
This file was created from the `pipreqs`_ command line tool and Sphinx
configuration inspection, e.g. the extension packages.

.. code:: bash

   $ pwd
   path/to/overlap_coupling/
   $ pipreqs --use-local --print --no-pin .

A minimal anaconda environment for building the documentation can be created
from an existing anaconda installation with the following commands.

.. code:: bash

   $ conda env create --file environment.yaml

You can learn more about Anaconda Python environment creation and management in
the `Anaconda Documentation`_.

C++ Libraries
=============

.. note:: 

   **Non-admin installations for Eigen and Boost are no longer required.** This project is built and deployed against C++
   libraries managed in Conda. See the Conda environment file and discussion for non-admin environment management.

* `Eigen`_ >= 3.3.7
* `BOOST`_ >= 1.59.0
* error\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/error_tools
* vector\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/vector_tools
* abaqus\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/abaqus_tools
* constitutive\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/constitutive_tools
* stress\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/stress_tools
* solver\_tools: https://re-git.lanl.gov/aea/material-models/solver_tools

All of the ``{error,vector,stress,solver,constitutive}_tools`` libraries are
pulled from their git repos by branch name and built with their respective cmake
files as part of the cmake build for this project.
