Notes:

Requires python libraries ( xml2, hdf5 )
Change LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include python installs of these libraries

Requires yaml-cpp and xdmf. These libraries must be compiled as shared libraries and installed on the system.
If they are not installed in a usual location, the path must be set when building with cmake.

Note: If using MOOSE the anaconda environment should be activated ( `conda activate moose` )
      before compiling any libraries. Using the same compiler as expected for MOOSE can help
      avoid any conflicts between library versions.
